           <!--  I served in the United States Navy for 9 years as an Aviation Ordnanceman with 2 Depoyments on the USS John C. Stennis for Operations Southern Watch and Enduring Freedom.  After my time was up on the USS John C. Stennis I continued on with my Naval Career to the Super Hornet Squadron VFA-122 based out of NAS Lemoore in the Central Valley of California.  After my Honorable Discharge from the Navy I decided to move back to the Buffalo Area and eventually enrolled in Erie Community College where I first decided to major in Computer Science and then I decided to switch to IT with a concentration in Oracle PL/SQL.
               After graduating from ECC I immediately decided to enroll in Alfred State's Bachelor of Technology in Network Administation.
