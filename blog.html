        Developing this blog is a work in progress and you may notice changes from time to time.  I'm currently studying Flask / Django and I'm developing a blog system.

      <h2><p>12/14/22 - Note to Employers.</p></h2>
      
      <p>
        If you look at my resume, you may notice I haven't been employed since the start of COVID (I was laid off).  This isn't due to a lack of trying, however, as I've submitted over 
        150 job applications and have had over 30 interviews.  My take from the limited feedback that I get is that there is a concern because I don't drive.  However, 
        I don't believe their should be any cause for concern.  As my prior manager at Datasure24 can attest to is that I'm dependable to show up to work on time and can 
        be counted on to come in and work overtime if needed.  I'm an <strong>Eagle Scout </strong>and <strong>U.S. Navy Veteran </strong>and many of the core values / creeds / laws and oaths of both
        organizations still resenate with me to this day; honor, courage, comittment, loyalty, trustworthy, etc.

      <h2><p>12/17/22  - ChatGPT and Script Kiddies</p></h2>

      <p>
         <a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ChatGPT</a> is an AI chatbot that is developed by OpenAI, and it answers the questions that users ask it without referencing the internet for answers with 
         a high amount of accuracy.  There are limitations though, it doesn't know about current events due to not being able to reference the internet.  It's not suposed to be able to be used for 
         nefarious purposes directly, however, as referenced<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzbLI6uumS8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>in this youtube video as you can see it doesn't answer the direct question and speaks of it illegaility.
         However, when posing the question in a scenario, the user can get the desired results.  
      </p>
      <p>
        In my opinion AI can be useful, however, when put in the wrong hands with someone with evil intent it can cause havoc.  I'll will be posting more about AI and chatGPT in the future.
