      <h2><p>First Post 12/14/22 - Note to Employers.</p></h2>
      
      <p>
        If you look at my resume, you may notice I haven't been employed since the start of COVID (I was laid off).  This isn't due to a lack of trying, however, as I've submitted over 
        150 job applications and have had over 30 interviews.  My take from the limited feedback that I get is that there is a concern because I don't drive.  However, 
        I don't believe their should be any cause for concern.  As my prior manager at Datasure24 can attest to is that I'm dependable to show up to work on time and can 
        be counted on to come in and work overtime if needed.  I'm an <strong>Eagle Scout </strong>and <strong>U.S. Navy Veteran </strong>and many of the core values / creeds / laws and oaths of both
        organizations still resenate with me to this day; honor, courage, comittment, loyalty, trustworthy, etc.
